        <h3>What is the Pomodoro Technique?</h3>
        <p>The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. It uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for tomato, after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer Cirillo used as a university student.</p>

        <h3>How do I use the timer?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>pick a task to work on</li>
          <li>start the timer and focus on the task for 25 minutes</li>
          <li>take a break for 5 or 15 minutes when the timer finishes</li>
          <li>repeat until the task is finished</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>What is the benefit of the Pomodoro Technique?</h3>
        <p>The Pomodoro Technique helps you resist all of those self-interruptions and re-train your brains to focus. Each pomodoro is dedicated to one task and each break is a chance to reset and bring your attention back to what you should be working on. </p>

        <h3>Why does it work?</h3>
        <p>A 25-minute Pomodoro session is long enough to get a little work done but not so long that it feels painful or overwhelming. Unlike trying to work without a break for hours, it's relatively easy to stack small sessions on top of each other. Four Pomodoro sessions can represent a productive morning. It's surprising how much you can accomplish in short bursts of focused work. After that, it's time for lunch or even a nap.</p>
